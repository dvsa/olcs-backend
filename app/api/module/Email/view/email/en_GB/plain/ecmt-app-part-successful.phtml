We have already notified you that your ECMT permit application <?php echo $this->applicationRef; ?> was partially successful.

Application status: Partially successful

During the current round of permit allocations, you have not been fully successful in getting all the permits that you applied for. We were oversubscribed and therefore needed to allocate a smaller number of permits to operators.

* Number of permits required: <?php echo $this->permitsRequired; ?>
* Number of permits granted: <?php echo $this->permitsGranted; ?>

The EU is close to agreeing a new law meaning UK operators will be able to carry out road haulage to EU member states until 31 December 2019. The new rules are set to be approved by the EU Parliament and Council in March and once agreed will allow you to make most journeys without a permit:

* You will be able to travel to any EU Member State (empty or laden) and return (empty or laden).
* You will be allowed to undertake a limited amount of 'cross-trade' and 'cabotage' work on a transitional basis – two such journeys per week for four months, reducing to one journey per week for the next three months.
* The proposed EU law will however not allow permit-free access to non-EU countries. You will require an ECMT permit to transit EU Member States to a 3rd countries such as Switzerland or Turkey.

We expect that ECMT permits will only be needed for:

* Operators wishing to undertake more than one cross-trade load as part of their journey. ECMT permits authorise up to 3 cross-trade loads.
* Operators who travel to non-EU Member States, through EU Member States – so for instance to Switzerland or Ukraine.

ECMT permits do not allow cabotage.

Next steps

You need to decide whether you still want your permit(s). If you do, you now need to pay the Permit Issuing total fee of £<?php echo $this->issueFeeTotal; ?> (£<?php echo $this->issueFeeAmount; ?> per permit) before receiving your paper based permit and corresponding logbook. These will be posted by first class recorded delivery.

You have until 23:59 on 21 March to pay for your allocated permits. If you do not pay the Permit Issuing fee in this time, the permits granted to your business will be automatically cancelled.

In addition, we have secured additional ECMT permits. Your application will automatically be considered for these permits and we will notify you if you receive any of these permits.
