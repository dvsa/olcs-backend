Your ECMT permit application <?php echo $this->escapeHtml($this->applicationRef); ?> has now been withdrawn as the issue fee has not been paid.

We advised in our previous email that you had 10 calendar days to accept the permits allocated after which they would be re-allocated. This period has now passed and the issue fee is not paid so the application is deemed to be withdrawn.

What happens next

Further permits may become available in the future but are not guaranteed.

You can consider applying for other types of international road haulage permits that are also available to UK hauliers https://www.gov.uk/guidance/international-authorisations-and-permits-for-road-haulage.
