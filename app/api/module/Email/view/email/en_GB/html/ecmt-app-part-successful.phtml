<p>Vehicle Operator Licensing</p>

<p>Your ECMT permit application <?php echo $this->escapeHtml($this->applicationRef); ?> has now been considered and processed.</p>

<h3>Application status: Partially successful</h3>
<p>During the current round of permit allocations, you have not been fully successful in getting all the permits that you applied for. We were oversubscribed and therefore needed to allocate a smaller number of permits to operators.
<ul>
    <li>Number of permits applied for: <?php echo $this->escapeHtml($this->permitsRequired); ?></li>
    <li>Number of permits allocated to you: <?php echo $this->escapeHtml($this->permitsGranted); ?></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>You now need to pay the £<?php echo $this->escapeHtml($this->issueFeeTotal); ?> Permit Issue fee before receiving your paper based permit and corresponding Logbook. These will be posted by first class recorded delivery and must be carried in your vehicle on all international transport journeys across the EU.</p>

<p>You have <?php echo $this->escapeHtml($this->paymentDeadlineNumDays); ?> working days to accept this permit allocation after which it will be re-allocated and your £<?php echo $this->escapeHtml($this->applicationFee); ?> application fee per permit is non-refundable.</p>

<h3>What happens next?</h3>
<p>Further permits may become available in the future but are not guaranteed.</p>
