<strong>
    I understand that by submitting this application I am accepting the additional undertakings below; that they will be
    recorded on the licence; that failure to comply with the conditions or undertakings recorded on the licence may
    result in the licence being revoked, suspended or curtailed; and that failure to comply with these conditions is
    also a criminal offence.
</strong>
<ul class="bullet">
    <li>
        I must be able to prove that I have a formal arrangement for access at all times to at least one vehicle
        registered or in circulation in Northern Ireland. This could be by specifying a vehicle for use under an
        O-licence or by demonstrating on request that I (the licence holder) has a vehicle available – so vehicles may
        be either wholly owned or held under a hire purchase, hire/leasing arrangement or other type of formal
        arrangement.
    </li>
    <li>
        I have an establishment in Northern Ireland with premises in which I keep core business documents. These include
        (as a minimum) accounting and personnel management documents and data on driving time and rest. I understand
        that the use of a PO Box or third party address is not permitted.
