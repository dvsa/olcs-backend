<h4>Condition 1</h4>
<p>The driver or owner of the vehicle, or some other paid intermediary, must have brought the passengers together for the purposes of making the journey. In addition, each journey must have been advertised to the public in order to create a genuine opportunity for members of the public to be carried on the particular journey in question, ie the journey is not an exclusive hiring for an individual or group, notwithstanding that separate fares are paid. Advertisement at a place of worship, a place of work, a club or other voluntary association for the information of people present at those places, or in periodicals circulated wholly or mainly among such persons, does not count as advertisement to the general public. Finally, in the event that there are multiple destinations, there should be differentiation of fares for the journey based on distance or time.</p>

<h4>Condition 2</h4>
<p>The driver or owner of the vehicle, or some other paid intermediary, must have initiated the making of the agreement for the payment of separate fares, and not by the passengers or any other party. In addition, as in condition 1, each journey must be advertised to the public beforehand as being open to passengers to be carried at separate fares.</p>
