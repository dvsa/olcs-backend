<ul class="list--bullet">
    <li>The Public Passenger Vehicles Act of 1981 states that the operation of public service vehicles cannot be your main occupation. Your PSV Restricted licence was originally granted on the basis that you meet the relevant main occupation criteria.  This must remain the case for you to retain your licence.</li>
    <li>A traffic commissioner can request evidence to prove that you still meet the criteria at any time. You are required to keep documents so you can prove that if asked.  The type of evidence can include, accounts, tax returns, P60, bank statements and financial records that separate PSV operation income and expenditure from income from your main occupation. You should also be able to demonstrate the time that you devote to both roles.</li>
    <li>If you fail to continue to meet the criteria, you must either apply for a standard licence, or surrender your restricted licence. The failure to notify of a change in your circumstances regarding the main occupation could impact on an operator's good repute.</li>
