        I must be able to prove that I have a formal arrangement for access at all times to at least one vehicle
        registered or in circulation in GB. This could be by specifying a vehicle for use under an O-licence or by
        demonstrating on request that I (the licence holder) has a vehicle available â€“ so vehicles may be either wholly
        owned or held under a hire-purchase, hire/leasing arrangement or other type of formal arrangement.

        I have an establishment in Great Britain (GB) with premises in which I keep core business documents. These
        include (as a minimum) accounting and personnel management documents and data on driving time and rest. I
        understand that the use of a PO Box or third party address is not permitted.
