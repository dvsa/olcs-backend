    I must be able to prove that I have a formal arrangement for access at all times to at least one vehicle registered
    or in circulation in GB. This could be by specifying a vehicle for use under an operatorâ€™s licence or by
    demonstrating on request that I (the licence holder) have a vehicle available, so that vehicles may be either wholly
    owned or held under a hire-purchase, hire / leasing or other type of formal arrangement;

    I have an establishment in Northern Ireland with premises in which I keep core business documents. These include
    (as a minimum) accounting and personnel management documents and data on driving time and rest. I understand
    that the use of a PO Box or third party address is not permitted.
