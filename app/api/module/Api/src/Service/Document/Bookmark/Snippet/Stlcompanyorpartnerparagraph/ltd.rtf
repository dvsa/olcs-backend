It is important that a director of the company (who is recorded as such at Companies House) attends the meeting.
If, exceptionally and with prior written approval of the traffic commissioner, someone who is not a director attends
on behalf of the company, that person must bring written authority, signed by a director on company headed paper,
stating that they have a right to speak and make binding decisions (including decisions which involve cost)
on the companyâ€™s behalf.
