AlignEntitiesToSchema.php

Is used to generate Doctrine Entities from the current database schema. Therefore it requires access to MySQL, so you probably want to run it from your Vagrant olcs_v1.

It takes a large amount of parameters, but 99% of the time the defaults can be used. To see the defaults, run

$ php AlignEntitiesToSchema.php --help

Tip: Copy and paste the suggested usage from the above command to run the task with the default parameters
